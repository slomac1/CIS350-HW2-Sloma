## **Interest**
* I have a small collection of Star Wars Legos and Puzzles. I have over 20 puzzles built that I rotate out on a shelf in my office. My pride and joy of the Legos is the UCS Millennium Falcon.
* I have recently started to try and do more self teaching in the form of game development, primarily using python and pygame. Most games I have an interest in making are 2D which pygame works fairly well for.
* When not doing school work or working, I am usually spending time with my wife and our two Australian Shepherds.
